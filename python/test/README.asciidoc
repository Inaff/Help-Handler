Testing
-------
To run the Help-Handler unit tests, simply run `python unit-test.py`. You may also test multiple versions of Python using Tox by running `tox`, or you can use Docker to run the tests in a virtualized environment with `docker build -f ./test/Dockerfile -t test . && docker run test`



Contributing
------------
If you'd like to submit a bugfix, I'd be glad to take a pull request or fix it myself given adequate description of the cause of the issue. If you'd like a feature added, it will be  considered so long as it's within the scope of this project.
