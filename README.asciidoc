'''


Raison D'Ãªtre
-------------
Having used countless programs from the commandline, the lack of user friendliness has always been frustrating, as well as the amount of boilerplate that would be copy/pasted from other projects to handle the very basic task of telling a user how to use the program, and what version of the program they're using is. I came across various projects for handling arguments, but none for help/version dialogue specifically, let alone in the many various programming languages that one may use. In many popular projects, simply trying to get usage help is a roll of the dice as to what argument works (nano doesn't support "help", openssl and gcc _only_ support "help" and "--help" respectively, etc.), and are case-sensitive which is not user friendly. Even Python's argparse throws "unrecognized arguments" for anything but "--help".

This library isn't meant to be another argument parser, but a one-file library to accomplish the simple task of outputting help dialogue and/or version information to be used with other libraries, in numerous programming languages.

Usage
------
Only one function call is required after importing/including the respective language's Help-Handler file. Most users will only be concerned with the _config()_ function to enable/disable matching of arguments which might conflict with your program (h, -h, --h, v, -v, --v), and _version()_ to pass your program's version.

You can refer to the readme and _examples_ folder in each language's folder for basic and more advanced usage, though there are few functions.

Planned Features
----------------
- Support for unicode in all language implementations. Some languages such as Python support this natively, but others often don't.
- Returning what type of arguments specifically were matched. This will allow using other libraries for handling options parsing without conflicts
- Line break at spaces according to terminal width
- Option to output specific dialogue on first program run


Contributing
------------
If you'd like to submit a bugfix, I'd be glad to take a pull request or fix it myself given adequate description of the cause of the issue. If you'd like a feature added, it will be  considered so long as it's within the scope of this project.
